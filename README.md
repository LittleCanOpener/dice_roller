        Why <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>:<br>
        Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

        <h3>Github</h3><p>
        <img src="assets/images/icons/github.png" width="40px" height="40x"><br>
        Why <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>:<br>
        Well It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work

        <h3>Dart</h3><p>
        <img src="assets/images/icons/dart.png" width="40" height="40"><br>
        Why <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a>:<br>
        Being a compiled language, Dart allows developers to discover programming errors during the compilation process. 
        Hence, it is considered a type-safe language. 
        On the other hand, 
        Java is an interpreted language and allows developers to find programming errors during the runtime.
